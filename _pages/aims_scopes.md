### Aims and Scopes
WG2.9 - Software Requirements Engineering
Established 1995

#### Aims
The aim of the Working Group is to develop a better understanding of:
* the elicitation, specification, analysis and management of the requirements for large and complex software intensive systems;
* the interpretation and documentation of those requirements in such a way as to permit the developer to construct a system which will satisfy them.

#### Scope
The Scope of the WG includes all aspects of requirements engineering. Some examples of areas of special interest are:
* formal representation schemes and requirements modelling;
* descriptions of the requirements engineering process;
* tools and environments to support requirements engineering;
* requirements engineering methods;
* requirements analysis and validation;
* requirements elicitation, acquisition and formalisation;
* methods and tools for verification of an implementation's compliance with requirements;
* reuse and adaptation of requirements;
* domain modelling and analysis;
* requirements engineering for distributed, safety-critical, composite, real-time and embedded systems.
